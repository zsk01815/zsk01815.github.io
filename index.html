<caption> <font color="white"> LSU Quarterback gets carried off the field by his teammates following an upset against Alabama </font> </caption>
</div>
<p> On Saturday November 9, 2019, the second ranked LSU Tigers took down the third ranked Alabama Crimson Tide. This is LSU's first win over the Crimson Tide in eight years, and the first under head coach Ed Orgeron. This is only Alabama's fifth loss at home under Nick Saban, who has been with the program since 2009. </p>
<p> After the game, celebrations ran high for the Tigers. Senior quarterback, Joe Burrow, was carried off the field by his teammates while flashing the famous "L" with his fingers. In another section of Bryant-Denny Stadium, key memebers of the infamous "DBU" vistited with Alabama recruits sitting behind the endzone, prompting them to rethink their commitment to the tide. As for Coach Orgeron, he supposedly went home and ate a ham sandwich with his wife. </p>

<p> This game had major effects on the College Football Playoff the following Tuesday. LSU's resume was finally strong enough for the Playoff Committee to put them at No. 1. Alabama moved back two spots, landing at No.5 behind Georgia, 4 and Clemson, 3. Ohio State was pushed back to the No. 2 spot for obvious reasons. With LSU securing the SEC West, the SEC championship could also set major stakes for who makes it in the four-team playoff should Georgia win out. With the SEC securing three of the top five teams in the country, it would not be surprising to see two teams make it in. </P>
